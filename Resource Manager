Difference between Application Manager and Application Master in YARN?

The terms Application Master and Application Manager are often used interchangeably. 
In reality Application Master is the main container requesting, launching and monitoring application specific resources, 
whereas Application Manager is a component inside ResourceManager. More details about Application Manager is given below.

The ApplicationsManager is responsible for maintaining a collection of submitted applications. 
After application submission, it first validates the application’s specifications and rejects any application that 
requests unsatisfiable resources for its ApplicationMaster (i.e., there is no node in the cluster that has enough 
resources to run the ApplicationMaster itself). It then ensures that no other application was already submitted with 
the same application ID—a scenario that can be caused by an erroneous or a malicious client. Finally, it forwards the 
admitted application to the scheduler. This component is also responsible for recording and managing finished applications 
for a while before they are completely evacuated from the ResourceManager’s memory. When an application finishes, 
it places an ApplicationSummary in the daemon’s log file. Finally, the ApplicationsManager keeps a cache of completed 
applications long after applications finish to support users’ requests for application data (via web UI or command line). 
The configuration property yarn.resourcemanager.max-completed-applications controls the maximum number of such finished 
applications that the ResourceManager remembers at any point of time. The cache is a first-in, first-out list, with the 
oldest applications being moved out to accommodate freshly finished applications.
